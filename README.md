# Vichan-Backup-script
Automated Vichan Backup and restore with Borg
This project provides a robust, secure, and automated solution for creating backups of a Vichan imageboard. It uses BorgBackup to create space-efficient, encrypted, and deduplicated backups and transfers them to a secondary machine on your local network, such as a Raspberry Pi.
This solution is designed for server administrators who want a "set it and forget it" system that protects against data loss from application errors, database corruption, or server hardware failure.
Features
Complete Snapshot: Backs up the entire MariaDB/MySQL database and all user-uploaded files and themes.
Fully Automated: Uses cron for scheduled backups without requiring any user interaction.
Secure: Employs end-to-end encryption. Data is encrypted both in transit (via SSH) and at rest (via Borg's repository encryption).
Highly Space-Efficient: Utilizes BorgBackup's block-level deduplication for fast, small incremental backups. Only new data is transferred after the initial backup.
Intelligent Retention: Automatically prunes old backups using a flexible daily, weekly, and monthly retention schedule to manage long-term storage space.
Off-Site LAN Storage: Transfers backups to a secondary machine on the local network for protection against primary server failure.
Resilient and Verifiable: Built on Borg's chunk-based architecture, which is resistant to backup chain corruption and allows for full data integrity checks.
Prerequisites
A running Vichan instance on a Debian-based server (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu).
A secondary Linux machine on the same local network to act as the backup server (a Raspberry Pi is perfect for this).
sudo access on both machines.
BorgBackup installed on both machines. You can install it with: sudo apt update && sudo apt install borgbackup.
Setup Instructions
These instructions will guide you through setting up the backup repository on your backup server and configuring the backup script on your Vichan server.

#Step 1: Prepare the Backup Server (e.g., Raspberry Pi)
First, we need to create a directory for the backups and give your user the correct permissions.
On your Backup Server:
#Replace 'pi' with your actual username if it is different.

# Create the directory that will hold the backup repository
sudo mkdir -p /path/to/your/borg_repo

# Give your user ownership of this new directory
sudo chown pi:pi /path/to/your/borg_repo
Use code with caution.
Bash

#Step 2: Initialize the Borg Repository
This command creates the encrypted repository. This is a one-time setup.
On your Backup Server:
# Run this command as your regular user (no sudo).
# Replace the path with the one you created above.
borg init --encryption=repokey /path/to/your/borg_repo
Use code with caution.
Bash
Borg will prompt you to create a new passphrase. This is the master password for your entire backup set. Choose a strong passphrase and save it securely in a password manager. If you lose this passphrase, your backups are unrecoverable.

#Step 3: Export the Repository Key
To allow for automated backups, we need to export the repository's key.
On your Backup Server:
# This will create a key file in your home directory.
borg key export /path/to/your/borg_repo ~/exported_borg_key
Use code with caution.
Bash
Borg will ask for the passphrase you just created to authorize this export.

#Step 4: Configure the Vichan Server
Now, we will set up the server that hosts your imageboard.
On your Vichan Server:
Copy the Repository Key:
Use scp to securely copy the key file from the backup server.
# Replace 'pi@raspberrypi.local' with your backup server's user and hostname/IP.
# This will ask for your backup server user's password.
scp pi@raspberrypi.local:~/exported_borg_key ~/.config/borg/repo.key
Use code with caution.
Bash
If you have not yet created the .config/borg directory, do so first with mkdir -p ~/.config/borg.
Enable Passwordless SSH Login:
For cron to run the script automatically, your Vichan server must be able to log into the backup server without a password.
# First, generate a key if you don't have one. Press Enter at all prompts.
ssh-keygen

# Now, copy the new key to your backup server.
# This will ask for your backup server user's password one last time.
ssh-copy-id pi@raspberrypi.local
Use code with caution.
Bash
Create the Backup Script:
Create a new file for the backup script.
nano $HOME/backup_vichan_borg.sh
Use code with caution.
Bash
Copy the entire contents of the backup_vichan_borg.sh script below into this file. Edit the "CONFIGURE YOUR SETTINGS HERE" section at the top with your specific database credentials, paths, and passphrase.
Make the Script Executable:
chmod +x $HOME/backup_vichan_borg.sh
Use code with caution.
Bash
Step 5: Automation and Testing
Run a Manual Test:
Execute the script manually to ensure everything is working correctly.
$HOME/backup_vichan_borg.sh
Use code with caution.
Bash
The first run will be slow as it uploads all data. Subsequent runs will be much faster.
Schedule with Cron:
Once the test is successful, schedule the script to run automatically.
crontab -e
Use code with caution.
Bash
Add the following line to the end of the file to schedule a backup for 2:00 AM every night. Replace your_user with your username on the Vichan server.
0 2 * * * /bin/bash /home/your_user/backup_vichan_borg.sh > /home/your_user/borg_backup_log.txt 2>&1
Use code with caution.
Cron
Restore Instructions
Restoring is a manual process to ensure safety.
Step 1: Create the Restore Script
On your Vichan Server:
# Create the script file
nano $HOME/restore_vichan_borg.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x $HOME/restore_vichan_borg.sh
Use code with caution.
Bash
Copy the entire contents of the restore_vichan_borg.sh script below into this file. Edit the configuration section to match your setup.
Step 2: Perform the Restore
List Available Backups:
First, find the exact "point in time" you want to restore.
# Set the BORG_REPO variable to your repository path
export BORG_REPO="ssh://pi@raspberrypi.local/path/to/your/borg_repo"
borg list
Use code with caution.
Bash
This will show a list of all available archives. Copy the name of the one you wish to restore (e.g., vichan-2025-06-13T13:44:46).
Run the Restore Script:
Execute the script with sudo, providing the archive name as an argument.
# WARNING: This is a destructive action.
sudo $HOME/restore_vichan_borg.sh vichan-2025-06-13T13:44:46
Use code with caution.
Bash
The script will display a final warning and require you to type "YES" to proceed.
